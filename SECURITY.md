- Regular security updates for all dependencies
- Automated vulnerability scanning of dependencies
- Implementation of proper CORS policies

### Development Security

- All code changes require security review
- Automated security testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Regular dependency updates to patch known vulnerabilities
